JETSON TX2 POWER MEASUREMENT
============


OBJECTIVE

   To measure Jetson TX2 power consumption


HOW TO BUILD and SELFTEST

    make                Build from source codes

    make check          Selftest with CIFAR-10 and MNIST dataset
                        Note that you should set variable CAFFE_HOME
                        in Makefile

    make debug          Build debug version binary and then do selftest with
                        CIFAR-10 and MNIST dataset. It will print more
                        messeages. Note that you should set variable CAFFE_HOME
                        in Makefile


HOW TO USE

    -h                  Print help message

    -c <component>      A component whose power consumption will be measured
                         * Supported components: all, cpu, gpu, ddr, wifi, soc

    -f <file name>      Path to statistics file. It will truncate content of
                        the old file and create new one

DESIGN PRINCIPLE

   In order to minimize measurement overhead, I used a lot of system calls.

      * time()
      * clock_gettime()
      * nanosleep()
      * access()
      * open()
      * lseek()
      * read()
      * write()
      * close()
      * fork()
      * waitpid()
      * exit()


SCRIPT USAGE EXAMPLE

   # Set GPU frequency to be fixed to 1122000000Hz (1.122GHz)
   sudo ./script/fix_gpu_freq 1122000000

   # Run experiments with all available GPU frequencies as fixed frequency
   # and default governor setup with CIFAR-10 dataset
   sudo bash script/iterate_gpu_freq.sh cifar-10 script/run_cifar10.sh

   # Run experiments with all available GPU frequencies as fixed frequency
   # and default governor setup with MNIST dataset
   sudo bash script/iterate_gpu_freq.sh mnist script/run_mnist.sh
