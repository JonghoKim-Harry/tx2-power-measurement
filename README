JETSON TX2 POWER MEASUREMENT
============


OBJECTIVE

   To measure Jetson TX2 power consumption


HOW TO BUILD and SELFTEST

    make                Build from source codes

    make check          Selftest with CIFAR-10 and MNIST dataset
                        Note that you should set variable CAFFE_HOME
                        in Makefile

    make debug          Build debug version binary and then do selftest with
                        CIFAR-10 and MNIST dataset. It will print more
                        messeages. Note that you should set variable CAFFE_HOME
                        in Makefile


HOW TO USE

    -h                  Print help message

    -c <component>      A component whose power consumption will be measured
                         * Supported components: all, cpu, gpu, ddr, wifi, soc

    -f <file name>      Path to statistics file. It will truncate content of
                        the old file and create new one

DESIGN PRINCIPLE

   * In order to minimize measurement overhead, I used a lot of system calls.
   
   * For portability, I used only C standard-compatible or POSIX-compatible
     Linux system calls. I did NOT used any of Linux-specific system calls.

CFLAGS FOR COMPILATION

   TRACE_CPU                        Trace CPU informations
   TRACE_DDR                        Trace DDR/MEM informations
   TRACE_CAFFE_TIMESTAMP            Trace Caffe timestamp (default: OFF)
   DEBUG                            Trace powertool debug (default: OFF)
   NDEBUG                           Suppress assert() defined by <assert.h>
                                    (default: ON)


SCRIPT USAGE EXAMPLE

   # Set GPU frequency to be fixed to 1122000000Hz (1.122GHz)
   sudo ./script/run/fix_gpu_freq 1122000000

   # Run experiments with all available GPU frequencies as fixed frequency
   # and default governor setup with CIFAR-10 dataset.
   #
   # Note that 2nd argument of script should be given as ABSOLUTE PATH: (ex) /bin/bash
   # This inconvenience is due to power measurement program's lack of argument processing,
   # NOT due to script itself
   sudo ./script/run/iterate_gpu_freq.sh cifar-10 /bin/bash ./script/run/run_cifar10.sh

   # Run experiments with all available GPU frequencies as fixed frequency
   # and default governor setup with MNIST dataset
   sudo ./script/run/iterate_gpu_freq.sh mnist /bin/bash ./script/run/run_mnist.sh

   #
   sudo ./script/run/iterate_gpu_freq.sh caffenet-cat /bin/bash ./script/run/run_caffenet.sh /home/nvidia/caffe/examples/images/cat.jpg

   #
   sudo ./script/run/iterate_gpu_freq.sh caffenet-fishbike /bin/bash ./script/run/run_caffenet.sh /home/nvidia/caffe/examples/images/fish-bike.jpg


   # Use tegrastats to measure power, etc.
   #
   # Note that there is sleep in the script, in order to cool down CPUs or GPU
   sudo ./script/run/use_tegrastats.sh 10 cifar10-tegralog-10ms.txt script/run/run_cifar10.sh

   # Run CaffeNet
   ./script/run/run_caffenet.sh /home/nvidia/caffe/examples/images/cat.jpg

   # Measure CaffeNet single image inference
   ./power_measurement -c gpu -f exp_result/caffenet/caffenet-cat_power.txt /bin/bash ./script/run/run_caffenet.sh /home/nvidia/caffe/examples/images/cat.jpg
