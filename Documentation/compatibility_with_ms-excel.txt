        Compatibility with MS Excel

* Units should be omitted. MS Excel is dumb, thus it only reads numbers.
  If units are attached, MS Excel will NOT draw graph correctly

* I put #N/A values to Caffelog in order to be compatible with MS Excel

* I set the first column header's name as  __GMT-Time-Stamp__, in order to
  remove any whitespace before first column header,
  because MS Excel recognizes whitespace as a delimiter
