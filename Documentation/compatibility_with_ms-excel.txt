        Compatibility with MS Excel

* Units should be omitted. MS Excel is dumb, thus it only reads numbers.
  If units are attached, MS Excel will NOT draw graph correctly

* I put #N/A values to Caffelog in order to be compatible with MS Excel

* Intentionally beginning each rows with one whitespace,
  because MS Excel recognizes whitespace as a delimiter
