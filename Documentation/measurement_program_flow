prepare_measurement()

   * Process arguments: For example, takes statistics file name
     'OOO_stats.txt' as an argument

   * Prepare log, stat file, column formats

   * Open files and prepare list of file descriptors

calculate_2ndstat() <---------------------- CHILD PROCESS COMPLETE

   * Read data from 'rawdata.bin',
     then write human-readable timestamp,
     power, frequency to 'OOO_stats.txt'

   * Calculate elapsed time from timestamp,
     energy from time and power, then write
     them to 'ooo_stats.txt'

   * When all writes to 'ooo_stats.txt' is done,
     then remove 'rawdata.bin'

RESULT

   * 'OOO_stats.txt'
