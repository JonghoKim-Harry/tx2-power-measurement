   * Write human-unreadable timestamp,         * Can run any shell command
     power, frequency to 'rawdata.bin'           independently with parent

    * Parallel execution with                  * We typically execute
      child process                              CNN inference

calculate_2ndstat() <------------------------- CHILD PROCESS COMPLETE

   * Read data from 'rawdata.bin',
     then write human-readable timestamp,
     power, frequency to 'stats.txt'

   * Calculate elapsed time from timestamp,
     energy from time and power, then write
     them to 'stats.txt'

   * When all writes to 'stats.txt' is done,
     then remove 'rawdata.bin'
