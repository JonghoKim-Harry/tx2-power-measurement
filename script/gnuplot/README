                               SCRIPTS FOR GNUPLOT

DEFAULT CONFIGURATION

   Gnuplot reads a startup file, ~/.gnuplot when it starts.
   Note that I placed .gnuplot in this directory

GNUPLOT ARGUMENTS

   * Gnuplot supports only up to 10 arguments: ARG0, ARG1, ..., ARG9
   * ARGC is the number of arguments

CO-WORKING WITH SHELL

   * Some features must be double-quoted
     (ex) set output "mnist_1122MHz.png"

NOTES ON BACKSLASH

   * There should be NO BLANK AFTER BACKSLASH in gpuplot
   * BACKSLASH AT THE END OF COMMENT makes gnuplot treat
     the next line also as comment
